#Oil crops: Include those in the top 15 and down to the top 50 until there are around 5 crops, 
#then see how many substantially different farming systems there are â€“ there might be some crops grown in 
#basically the same way as each other. There are already 5 oil crops in the top 15 crops list: 
#seed cotton, rapeseed, ground nuts, oil palm and sunflower seed. Therefore, I am  going to proceed with 
#the screening methodology.

library(metagear)

# Steps:
#   1. Load data set of merged references downloaded from Scopus and WOS for cereals
#   2. First screen of references
#   3. Add exclusion reason column 
#   4. Create two data frames: one with first screen excluded studies and one with the studies that will go through
#      a second screen
#   5. Second screen of studies
#   6. Add the studies excluded in the second screen to the excluded data frame and create a data frame of included
#      studies

# 1. Load data set of merged references downloaded from Scopus and WOS for cereals

# 2. First screen of references

# Now  I have to screen the references to classify as relevant (YES), maybe relevant (maybe) or 
# not relevant (NO) to this meta-analysis.
# Initialize adds three columns: study_ID, reviewers (only me, Christina) and INCLUDE (yes, no, maybe).
# Saves automatically a copy, called "effort_Christina".

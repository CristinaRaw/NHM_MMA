In this script I am going to analyse biodiversity response to agricultural practices using the log response ratio data. This data comes directly from log response ratio reuslts of meta-analyses, and from back transforming percentage change data into log response ratio. 

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
gc()

library(readxl)
library(here)

d <- read_xlsx(here("Datasets", "06.Excel_Dataset_to_model_LRR.xlsx"))

```

```{r}
m <- lm(LRR ~ Treatment, data = d )
summary(m)
Value ~ blmer(AgriculturalSystem + CropClass + Practice + Metric + (1|Crop) + (1|ID) â€¦ 
```

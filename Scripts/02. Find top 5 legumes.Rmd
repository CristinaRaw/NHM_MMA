### 1. Find the first 5 legume crops in the top 50 crops by area harvested list.

Since there is only one legume crop (beans) in the top 15 crops list, I am going to include the first 5 legume crops
in the top 50 crops (by area harvested) from FAOSTAT's data. The list of crops recognised as legumes (or pulses) 
by FAO can be found in the following link: [legumes](https://www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/economic/faodef/faodefe.htm#NOTE)

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# 1. Load data

crops <- read.csv("Data/00.Raw_Data/00.Scoping/Crops_and_livestock_products/Crops/FAOSTATcrops_primary_total_2019.csv")

# 2. Subset the hetare data and sort from most area harvested used to least surface used

crops_ha <- subset(crops, crops$Unit == "ha")

crops_ha <- crops_ha[order(-crops_ha$Value),]

# 3. Find the the first 5 legume crops in the top fifty crops. 

crops_ha <- crops_ha[c(1:50),]

crops_ha$Item

```

The first five legume crops found in the top 50 crops by hectares harvested are:

  - Beans, dry
  - Cow peas
  - Chick peas
  - Peas, dry
  - Pulses, nes

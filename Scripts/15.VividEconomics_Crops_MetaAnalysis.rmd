I am going to perform some kind of meta analysis for the crops Vivid Economics are interested in, which are: maize, cotton, oil palm, soybean, sugarcane and potato.

The data set consists on measures of biodiversity under different agricultural production systems for the different crops.

1.    Split data set according to type of effect size
2.    Calculate the weighted mean for the % change data
- % Change weighted mean estimates
- % Change plotted means
3.    Calculate the weighted mean for the LRR data 
- LRR weighted mean estimates
- LRR plotted means

### Load and clean data set

Yes, I know the de data set should be perfectly clean, but it's not.

```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load all packages I will need:

library(here) # To tell RMD where to find and store files
library(knitr) # To make RMD tables

library(ggpubr) # To arrange plots

```

```{r, include = FALSE}

d <- read.csv2(here("Data/00.Raw_Data/05.Analysis_data", "V2_Magpie_Crops_Quantitative_spreadsheet.csv"))

d$Crop[d$Crop == "Bt_Cotton"]<- "Cotton"
d$Crop[d$Crop == "Bt_Eggplant"]<- "Eggplant"

d$Crop[d$Crop == "GM_Rape"]<- "Rape_seed"
d$Crop[d$Crop == "Bt_Broccoli"]<- "Broccoli"
d$Crop[d$Crop == "GM_Potato"]<- "Potato"
d$Crop[d$Crop == "GM_Cotton"]<- "Cotton"
d$Crop[d$Crop == "GM_Tomato"]<- "Tomato"
d$Crop[d$Crop == "Gm_Strawberry"]<- "Strawberry"

unique(d$Effect_size) # Unify effect size names 

d$Effect_size[d$Effect_size == "Hedges' d"]<- "Hedges_d"

which(d$Effect_size == "") # Remove useless row with no data
d <- subset(d,d$Effect_size != "")

d <- subset(d, d$Crop == "Maize"|   # Subset data of the crops Vivid  Evonomics
            d$Crop == "Cotton"|     # are interested in
            d$Crop == "Oil_palm"|
            d$Crop == "Soybean"|
            d$Crop == "Sugarcane"|
            d$Crop == "Strawberry"|
            d$Crop == "Broccoli"|
            d$Crop == "Tomato"|
            d$Crop == "Potato"|
            d$Crop == "Eggplant")

```

## Dataset for VividEvonomics, brief data digest

The data set consists of biodiversity observations under different agricultural production systems, for the crops Vivid Economics are interested in:

-   Maize
-   Cotton
-   Oil palm
-   Soybean
-   Sugar cane
-   Fruits, Nuts, Vegetables

For these crops, there are the following number of observations under the different production systems:

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# See how many observations per crop and production system

crop_reshape <- select(d, Crop, agricultural_system)
crop_reshape <- as.data.frame(table(crop_reshape))

crop_reshape <- crop_reshape %>% group_by(Crop) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = agricultural_system,
                                          values_from = Freq)

kable(crop_reshape, row.names = TRUE, caption = "Number of observations per per crop and production system ")
```

I am going to get estimates for any crop that has more than 10 observations for any of the production systems.  The rule of thumb for meta-analyses is 10 observations per level (in this case per crop):

```{r}

# Which crops have more than 10 observations for any of the agricultural production systems?

focal_crops <- crop_reshape  %>% filter_at(vars(2:7), any_vars(. > 10))

kable(focal_crops, row.names = TRUE, 
      caption = "Crops with > 10 observations in one or more production system category")

```

Therefore, I am going to calculate estimates for **cotton, maize, oil palm,
potato, soybean, sugarcane**

## 1. Split data set according to type of effect size

```{r, results = 'hide'}

# Subset crops of interest

d <- d[d$Crop %in% focal_crops$Crop, ]

# Split data set per type of effect size

unique(d$Effect_size) #Check effect sizes are correct

effect_size <- unique(d$Effect_size)  # Make list that stores data split per type 
es_list <- list()                     # of effect size

for (es in effect_size){
data <- dplyr :: filter( d , Effect_size == es)
es_list[[es]] <- data
}

list2env(es_list, envir=.GlobalEnv)   # Make a data frame of each of the data 
                                      # sets in the list  
```

So now, I have four types of data:

-   Log response ratio: 23 observations
-   Percentage change: 191 observations
-   Hedge's g: 137 observations
-   Plain species richness and abundance

```{r, include = FALSE}

write.csv(Percentage_change, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "01.Percentage_change.csv"))
write.csv(Percentage_change, here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "01.Percentage_change.csv"))
write.csv(Hedges_d, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "02.Hedges_d.csv"))
write.csv(Hedges_d, here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "02.Hedges_d.csv"))
write.csv(LRR, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "03.LRR.csv"))
write.csv(LRR, here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "03.LRR.csv"))

```

### What can I do with the data?

With Hedge's g data I can get more accurate estimates as I include more data and from more sources but I cannot really compare.

With species richness and abundance data I can calculate mean but I cannot do a proper

Since the data comes from syntheses, many observations do not have variance data, which is needed to perform a statistical meta-analysis. There are two possible options:

a.  If the synthesis provides an estimate and nothing else, calculate the average

b.  If the synthesis provides a confidence interval or a 'sample size'(the number of comparisons or studies that were synthesized), use this information to calculate a weighted mean. 

Therefore, I will do the following with the available data:

-   Log response ratio: calculate the weighted mean
-   Percentage change: calculate the weighted mean
-   Hedge's g: get more accurate estimates as I include more data and from more sources
-   Plain species richness and abundance: *think about what to do* 

*I will calculate the weighted mean for those crops with > 10 observations for a certain agricultural system. Which are:*

  - For the % Change data: cotton, maize, oil palm, potato, rape seed, soy bean, sugar cane and sunflower. So NOT rice and NOT wheat
  - For the LRR data: cassava, maize and straw cereal. so NOT oil palm and NOT wheat
  
Each review observation will be weighted as 1, because it comes from one study. Meta-analysis observations will be weighted according to the number of studies included in the meta-analysis.

## 2. Calculate weighted mean for the % change data

Since calculating the weighted mean with percentages can inflate results, I am going to transform the % change data that comes from LRR back to LRR applying the following formula: *Check how means are affected when doing them with % data*

$$LRR= ln((Percentage change/100) + 1)$$
```{r, include = FALSE}

rm(list = ls())
gc()

Percentage_change <- read.csv( here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "01.Percentage_change.csv"), row.names = 1)
LRR <- read.csv(here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "03.LRR.csv"), row.names = 1)

```

```{r}

# Subset percentage change data that comes from LRR and remove those rows from the percentage change data set

perc_to_lrr <- subset(Percentage_change, 
                      Synthesis_type == "Meta-Analysis")

Percentage_change <- subset(Percentage_change,
                            Synthesis_type != "Meta-Analysis")

# Back transform the percentage data that comes from LRR into % Change

perc_to_lrr$Percentage_change <- as.numeric(perc_to_lrr$Percentage_change)  # Transform column class into numeric

perc_to_lrr$Value = log((perc_to_lrr$Percentage_change/100) + 1) # Transform LRR into percentage change

LRR <- rbind(LRR, perc_to_lrr) # rbind LRR data frames

```

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Save new data frames

write.csv(Percentage_change, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "01.Percentage_change.csv"))
write.csv(Percentage_change, here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "01.Percentage_change.csv"))
write.csv(LRR, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "03.LRR.csv"))
write.csv(LRR, here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "03.LRR.csv"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Digest percentage change data 

perc_reshape <- select(Percentage_change, Crop, agricultural_system)
perc_reshape <- as.data.frame(table(perc_reshape))

perc_reshape <- perc_reshape %>% group_by(Crop) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = agricultural_system,
                                          values_from = Freq)

kable(perc_reshape, row.names = TRUE, caption = "Percentage change data digest")

```

I can calculate estimates and compare:

-   Maize: conservation, mixed, transgenic
-   Cotton: mixed and transgenic
-   Oil palm: all data on conventional
-   Soybean: not much, can get an estimate for mixed cropping
-   Sugarcane: conservation and conventional
-   Potato (potentially): transgenic

### Add column of weight

Each review observation will be weighted as 1, because it comes from one study. Meta-analysis' observations will be weighted according to the number of studies included in the meta-analysis.

```{r, include = FALSE}

rm(list=ls())
gc()

Percentage_change <- read.csv( here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "01.Percentage_change.csv"), row.names = 1)

```

```{r, results = 'hide'}

Percentage_change$weight <- ""   # Add empty column where I will store the weights

# Add a weight of 1 to reviews

unique(Percentage_change$Synthesis_type) # All data comes from review
Percentage_change$weight[Percentage_change$Synthesis_type == "Review"] <- 1

```

### Calculate weighted mean of the percentage changes weighting by the weight column

```{r, results = 'hide'}

names(Percentage_change)                 # Adjust column classes to number
class(Percentage_change$weight)
class(Percentage_change$Percentage_change)

Percentage_change$weight <- as.numeric(Percentage_change$weight)
Percentage_change$Percentage_change <- as.numeric(Percentage_change$Percentage_change)

crop <- unique(Percentage_change$Crop)   # Make list that stores data split per type 
crop_list<- list()  

for (cr in crop){
data <- dplyr :: filter( Percentage_change , Crop == cr)
crop_list[[cr]] <- data
}

list2env( crop_list, envir = .GlobalEnv) # Make a data frame for each crop

# Calculate weighted mean

mean_maize <- Maize %>%
                group_by(agricultural_system) %>%
                summarise(wheighted.mean = 
                            weighted.mean(Percentage_change, weight)) %>%
                cbind(crop = "Maize")
  

mean_cotton <- Cotton %>%
                  group_by(agricultural_system) %>%
                  summarise(wheighted.mean = 
                              weighted.mean(Percentage_change, weight)) %>%
                  cbind( crop = "Cotton" )

mean_oil <- Oil_palm %>%
                drop_na(Percentage_change) %>%
                group_by(agricultural_system) %>%
                summarise(wheighted.mean = 
                            weighted.mean(Percentage_change, weight)) %>%
                cbind( crop = "Oil palm" )

mean_soy <- Soybean %>%
              drop_na(Percentage_change) %>%
              group_by(agricultural_system) %>%
              summarise(wheighted.mean = 
                          weighted.mean(Percentage_change, weight)) %>%
              cbind( crop = "Soybean" )

mean_sugar <- Sugarcane %>%
                  drop_na(Percentage_change) %>%
                  group_by(agricultural_system) %>%
                  summarise(wheighted.mean = 
                              weighted.mean(Percentage_change, weight)) %>%
                  cbind( crop = "Sugarcane")

mean_effect <- rbind( mean_maize, mean_cotton, mean_oil, mean_soy, mean_sugar) # Merge in one data frame

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

mean_effect <- relocate(mean_effect, crop, .before = agricultural_system)

kable(mean_effect, row.names = TRUE, caption = "% change weighted mean per crop and production system")

```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}

write.csv(mean_effect, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "08.VividEconomicsMeanEffect.csv"))
write.csv(mean_effect, here("Outputs/07.Analysis", "08.VividEconomicsMeanEffect.csv"))

```

### Plot 

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Plot 

rm(list = ls())
gc()

mean_effect <- read.csv( here("Outputs/07.Analysis",   # Load data
                                    "08.VividEconomicsMeanEffect.csv"), row.names = 1)

mean_effect <- mean_effect[mean_effect$agricultural_system != "unclassified",] # Remove unclassified agricultural system

unique(mean_effect$agricultural_system)

```

```{r, results = 'hide'}

range(mean_effect$wheighted.mean) # Get axis limits
unique(mean_effect$crop) # Get number of facet rows

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

ggplot( mean_effect, aes(wheighted.mean, size = 1, fill = agricultural_system)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap (~ crop, nrow = 5, ncol = 1, scales = "free_x") + 
  xlab("Wheighted mean") +
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_discrete(breaks=NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous( limits = c(-80, 70), breaks= c(-80,-35, -19, -2, 0, 5, 13, 15, 67)) +
  theme( panel.background = element_blank(),
         axis.line.x.bottom=element_line(color="black"),
         panel.spacing.y=unit(1.5, "lines"),
         panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA),
         axis.text.x= element_text(size = 7)) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  labs(title = "Biodiveristity % change under different agricultural systems and crops")


```

## 3. Calculate the wheighted mean for the LRR data 

```{r, include = FALSE}

rm(list = ls())
gc()

LRR <- read.csv(here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "03.LRR.csv"), row.names = 1)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Digest the log response ratio data

lrr_reshape <- select(LRR, Crop, agricultural_system)
lrr_reshape <- as.data.frame(table(lrr_reshape))

lrr_reshape <- lrr_reshape %>% group_by(Crop) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = agricultural_system,
                                          values_from = Freq)

kable(lrr_reshape, row.names = TRUE, caption = "LRR change data digest")

```

```{r, include = FALSE}

### Back transform some percentage data in the data frame into LRR
# Some data in the LRR data frame is in percentage format, I have to back transform it # into LRR.

perc_to_lrr <- LRR[5:7, 38]  # Subset % change data to be back transformed

perc_to_lrr <- log((perc_to_lrr/100) +1)  # Back transform into LRR

LRR[5:7, 37] <- perc_to_lrr  # Input values in the LRR data frame

```


### Add column of weight

Each review observation will be weighted as 1, because it comes from one study. Meta-analysis’ observations will be weighted according to the number of studies included in the meta-analysis

```{r, results = 'hide'}

unique(LRR$Synthesis_type) # All LRR data comes from meta-analyses

LRR$weight <- ""  # Add empty column where I will store the weights

LRR$weight[c(1:23)] <- LRR$N_Studies[c(1:23)]  # Add number of studies as weight

```

### Calculate weighted mean 

I am going to calculate the wheighted mean for the following group:

-   Maize: conservation and mixed

```{r, results = 'hide'}

names(LRR)                  # Adjust column classes to numeric
class(LRR$weight)
class(LRR$Value)

LRR$weight <- as.numeric(LRR$weight)

unique(LRR$Crop)
maize  <- subset(LRR, LRR$Crop == "Maize") # Subset maize data

#Calculate weighted mean

mean_maize <- maize %>%
                group_by(agricultural_system) %>%
                summarise(wheighted.mean = 
                            weighted.mean(Value, weight)) %>%
                cbind(crop = "Maize")
```

I also want to show the weighted mean back transformed into percentage. I can back transform LRR into percentage applying the following formula: 

$$Percentage Change = 100 * e^{LRR} - 1$$

```{r}

# Add column of back transformed LRR into percentage 

mean_maize <- mutate(mean_maize, Percentage = 100 * (exp(wheighted.mean) - 1))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

mean_maize <- relocate(mean_maize, crop, .before = agricultural_system)

kable(mean_maize, row.names = TRUE, caption = "LRR weighted mean")

```

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Save

write.csv(mean_maize, here("Data/01.Processed_Data/05.Analysis", "08.LRR_VividEconomicsMeanEffect.csv"))

```


## Plot 

```{r, message = FALSE}

In this script I am going to digest the updated data set so we can convince Sainsbury's that the project is possible and they should stay with us and save biodiversity!!

The data consists of percentage change and Log Response Ratio measures of biodiversity (e.g., abundance) under different agricultural systems. I have extracted the data from syntheses (reviews or meta-analyses) on how agricultural production systems impact biodiversity. The aim is to provide an easy overview of the data set. I am going to classify the data  according magpie crop classification and and VividEconomics land-use classes.  

VividEconomics has the following cropland land use classes:
  - Annual crops: rice, maize, tropical cereals, temperate cereals, cotton seed, groundnuts, sunflower, other oil crops (including rape seed), fruits, vegetables and nuts.
  
  - Perennial crops: sugar beet, sugar cane, short rotation grasses (bioenergy), short rotation trees (bioenergy), potato, oil palm and tropical roots.
    
  - N-fixing crops: pulses and soy.  
   
Magpie crop classes are the following:

### 1.1 Data per VividEconomics cropland land-use classes:

```{r}

     # Annual crops

annual_crops <- subset(d, d$Crop == "Rice" | d$Crop == "Bt_Rice" |
                          d$Crop == "Maize" | d$Crop == "Bt_Maize" |
                          d$Crop == "Barley" | d$Crop == "Straw_cereals" |
                          d$Crop == "Small_grain" | d$Crop == "Sorghum" |
                          d$Crop == "Wheat" | d$Crop == "Cotton" |
                          d$Crop == "Bt_Cotton" | d$Crop == "GM_Cotton" |
                          d$Crop == "Sunflower" | d$Crop == "Bt_Sunflower" |

                          d$Crop == "GM_Tomato" | d$Crop == "Gm_Strawberry")

length(annual_crops$Crop) # 355 records for annual crops
length(unique(annual_crops$Paper_ID)) # 17 papers

# Perennial crops

perennial_crops <- subset(d, d$Crop == "Sugarbeet" | d$Crop == "Sugarcane" |
                             d$Crop == "Potato" | d$Crop == "Bt_Potato"| d$Crop == "GM_Potato" |
                             d$Crop == "Oil_palm" | d$Crop ==  "Cassava")
                              
length(perennial_crops$Crop) # 214 records for perennial crops

        # N-Fixing crops
                              
N_fixing_crops <- subset(d, d$Crop == "Soybean" | d$Crop == "Maize_Legume" |
                             d$Crop == "Legume")

length(N_fixing_crops$Crop) # 25 records for N-Fixing crops
length(unique(N_fixing_crops$Paper_ID)) # 5 papers

```


### 1.2 Data per magpie class

```{r, echo = FALSE}

magpie <- as.data.frame(table(d$magpie_class))
colnames(magpie) <- c("Magpie class", "Number of observations")
kbl(magpie, caption = "Number of observations per magpie category")


```

### 1.2 Data per crop

```{r, echo = FALSE}

crop <- as.data.frame(table(d$Crop))
colnames(crop) <- c("Crop", "Number of observations")
kbl(crop, caption = "Number of observations per crop")

d %>% group_by(Crop) %>%  
  summarise(count = n_distinct(Paper_ID))

```
